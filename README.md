## Overview

UniOr PET (University of Oriental Studies Post-Editing Tool) is a web-based platform designed for translation post-editing research and practice. The tool provides comprehensive metrics collection, time tracking, and user-friendly interfaces for improving machine translation outputs through human post-editing.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Segment-by-segment post-editing**: Edit translations with contextual information
- **Multiple timer modes**: 
  - Current Timer: Automatic time tracking during editing
  - PET Timer: Manual control with pause/resume functionality
- **Real-time metrics**: Track insertions, deletions, and editing time
- **Progress persistence**: Save and resume work across sessions
- **Multi-user support**: Authentication and user-specific data management

### Advanced Features
- **Idle time detection**: Separate tracking of active vs. idle editing time
- **Context visualization**: Configurable context window for surrounding segments
- **Horizontal/vertical layouts**: Flexible editing interface options
- **Review functionality**: Comprehensive overview of all edited segments
- **Export capabilities**: Download results in CSV and JSON formats
- **MTQE scoring**: Automatic calculation of BLEU, CHRF, and TER metrics

### Technical Features
- **MongoDB integration**: Secure cloud-based data storage
- **Auto-save functionality**: Automatic progress preservation
- **Responsive design**: Mobile and desktop compatibility
- **Real-time collaboration**: Multi-user project management capabilities

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB instance (local or cloud-based)
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unior-pet.git
   cd unior-pet
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure environment**
   Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
   ```toml
   MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING = "your_mongodb_connection_string"
   VERSION = "1.0.0"
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Authentication**: Register a new account or login with existing credentials
2. **File Upload**: Upload source and translation files (one sentence per line)
3. **Timer Mode Selection**: Choose between Current Timer or PET Timer modes
4. **Post-Editing**: Edit translations segment by segment with real-time feedback
5. **Review and Export**: Review all edits and download results

### Input Format

The tool expects two text files:
- **Source file**: Original text, one sentence per line
- **Translation file**: Machine translation output, one sentence per line

Both files must have the same number of lines.

### Output Formats

- **CSV**: Detailed metrics including edit times, insertions, deletions
- **JSON**: Structured data with source, original, and post-edited segments
- **Database**: Persistent storage in MongoDB for session management

## Research Applications

UniOr PET is designed to support various research scenarios:

### Translation Quality Assessment
- Measure post-editing effort through time and edit distance metrics
- Compare different machine translation systems
- Analyze translator behavior patterns

### User Studies
- Controlled experiments with different interface configurations
- Comparative studies between timer modes
- Analysis of cognitive load through idle time tracking

### Productivity Analysis
- Measure translation productivity improvements
- Identify segments requiring most editing effort
- Track learning curves over multiple sessions

## Metrics and Evaluation

### Collected Metrics
- **Temporal metrics**: Editing time, idle time, pause duration
- **Edit distance metrics**: Character/word insertions and deletions
- **Quality metrics**: BLEU, CHRF, TER scores
- **Behavioral metrics**: Pause patterns, segment navigation

### Statistical Analysis
The tool provides built-in statistical analysis including:
- Average editing time per segment
- Distribution of edit operations
- Quality improvement measurements
- Productivity trends over time

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Custom CSS**: Responsive design and user experience
- **JavaScript integration**: Real-time interactions and timer management

### Backend
- **Python**: Core application logic
- **MongoDB**: Data persistence and user management
- **AsyncIO**: Asynchronous database operations

### Data Models
- **EditingSession**: Tracks timing and activity data
- **EditMetrics**: Stores post-editing measurements
- **TimeTracker**: Manages different timer modes and calculations
